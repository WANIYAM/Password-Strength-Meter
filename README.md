# Password Strength Meter

## Overview
This is a **real-time password strength meter** built using **Streamlit**. The application provides instant feedback on password security, helping users create stronger passwords.

## Features
- **Real-time Feedback**: Password strength is updated as the user types.
- **Blacklist Check**: Identifies and warns against common weak passwords.
- **Strength Indicators**: Uses color-coded bars to show password security levels.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides tips on how to strengthen weak passwords.
- **Strong Password Generator**: Suggests a randomly generated strong password.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-meter.git
   cd password-strength-meter
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install streamlit
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works
1. Enter a password in the input field.
2. The app evaluates the password in real-time based on:
   - Length (minimum 8 characters recommended)
   - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Presence of numbers (0-9)
   - Inclusion of special characters (!@#$%^&*)
3. A **progress bar** visually indicates strength.
4. If weak, it suggests **ways to improve**.
5. Provides a **secure password recommendation** if necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Primary Language)
- **Streamlit** (Web UI Framework)
- **Regular Expressions (re module)** (Password Validation)
- **Random Module** (Strong Password Generation)
